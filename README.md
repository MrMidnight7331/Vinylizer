# Vinylizer

Can't decide what side you wanna listen to on vinyl? I build a small Python tool to randomise your vinyl albums! Pretty simple to use and straight forward!

R: Randomly going through the JSON config and pick a album and a random side.
A: Prompts to add a album and its sides.
L: List all album available in the JSON config
Q: Quit
